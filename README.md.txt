Smart Crop Disease Prediction and Management System Using AI

This project presents an AI-powered system to detect and predict crop diseases using two approaches:
1. Image-based classification using the VGG16 deep learning model.
2. Environmental data-based prediction using the Random Forest algorithm.

It supports crops such as tomato, potato, maize, grapes, and watermelon, and provides organic treatment suggestions to promote sustainable agriculture.

ðŸš€ Features
- VGG16-based CNN model to detect visible crop diseases from leaf images.
- Random Forest model to predict disease occurrence using temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and rainfall.
- Web interface to upload images or enter environmental data.
- Organic treatment recommendations (biopesticides, crop rotation, etc.).
- Scalable and adaptable for various crops and conditions.
